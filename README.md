## Hi there 👋 I'm Tzu-Jo (Jocelyn) Hsu

<h2> About Me : </h2>

🎓 I am currently pursuing a Masters Degree in Data Science at [__University of Michigan -Ann Arbor__](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/data-science-masters-program.html). My undergraduate studies at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University provided me with a foundation in both finance and information science.

💼 I have *2+ years* of data relevant internship/co-op/research assitant experience working with data science and machine learning.

I'm a self-motivated learner with a deep passion for data science and machine learning. I constantly seek out new challenges and opportunities to expand my expertise, whether through working on innovative projects💡, exploring the latest research📚, or mastering advanced tools and techniques 🛠️.

📚 I'm currently a Graduate Student Instructor for the course [Information Retrieval (SI650/EECS549)](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/courses/650) at UMSI. In this role, I lead engaging weekly discussions 💬, design comprehensive course assignments 📝, and hold office hours to assist students with their questions and concerns ❓.

🔭 Here are the companies where I have acquired valuable data-related experience:

* *Rocket Comapnies -Amrock LLC*
