# üëã Hi there ‚Äî I'm Jocelyn (Tzu-Jo) Hsu

I'm a data scientist and engineer with **2+ years of experience** across marketing tech and finance. 

I have **2+ years of experience** in data and developer roles across the marketing and finance sectors through internships and co-ops. These experiences pushed me to build robust, scalable solutions that bridge data, product thinking, and engineering. I constantly seek new challenges and opportunities to expand my expertise.
